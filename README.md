--------------------
st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.


Requirements

In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.

Patching
--------

```bash
./apply-patches.sh
# (vim will open repeatedly, fix the conflicts)
# apply this: https://github.com/Dreomite/st/commit/e3b821dcb3511d60341dec35ee05a4a0abfef7f2
```

Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install

----------
If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

    tic -sx st.info
